  1. Workshop is experiencing technical issues, who should I reach out to?
      * For  technical assistance during a workshop, please reach out to Liz Gerner at (781)-974-8511 or reach out in our slack volunteer channel to get in touch immediately with a management team member to assist you. 
  2. Participant has not shown up to the workshop, what should I do now? 
      * If a participant has not shown up five minutes past the start of the session please contact your regional coordinator. They will work with shelter coordinators to find the participant. If after 15 minutes the participant has still not shown up, you may exit the session.
  3. Where can I find the resume templates?
      * The resume templates can be found in the volunteer community portal under the training documents section. Also a copy of the templates will be provided in the onboarding training packet given during your orientation. 
  4. My participant is not motivated, what should I do now? 
      * Everyone has their off days, participants are no different. If you are struggling to connect with your participant we find it's helpful to take a step back. Switching the topic of the conversation for a few minutes to a more lighter subject may be helpful in connecting with your participant. 
  5. Participants have a large gap of time between work, how should I advise my participant to explain this in interviews? 
      * They should  be truthful without going into unnecessary detail. A basic template for their answer could be: “I [reason you were not employed]. During that time, [what you did during the gap]. Returning to work was top of mind during that period and I'm ready to do that now. 
  6. Do I have to give my contact info to the participant? 
      * No, you may  give up as much information as you are comfortable with. Lazarus Rising does not reveal anything aside from your first name to anyone to protect your privacy. 
  7. It’s hard to hear my participant, how should I handle this? 
      * Ask your participant to speak directly into the microphone. If the issue still persists, feel free to reach out to the regional coordinator who will work with the shelter coordinator to handle any outside noise. 
  8. My participant is going to need another session to finish up, how do I set this up?
      * Once the workshop has been completed, be sure to fill out the post workshop completion form. There will be a section on the form where you may fill out where your participant and you left off.
